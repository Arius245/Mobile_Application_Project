This is a project I created using what I learned from a course I took called NMD 445: Mobile Applications. The project is a mobile application that allows users to post their recommendations for various forms of media (movies, TV shows, music, etc.). This project was coded using JavaScript and React Native.

This project was also coded to function using Expo Go.
